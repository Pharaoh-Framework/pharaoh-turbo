## About

Yaroo is a modern [Server-Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) framework written
on-top of [Pharaoh](https://github.com/codekeyz/pharaoh) to make backend development in Dart
easy and peasy. It is very well in active development and is in use on projects such as
[Dart Blog](https://dart-blog.onrender.com).

Writing your backend in [Dart](https://dart.dev) can quickly turnout to be a daunting task, maybe
not worth pursing. Yaroo aims to be a framework that makes the necessary/hard decisions so you can have an easy-time 
focusing on just enough code that covers your business logic.

The almost non-existence of an excellent database agnostic [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) that
is  Yaroo helps solve these issues by allowing multiple packages
to work together within one repository, whilst being totally independent of each
other. Features include:

- Middlewares.
- Controllers.
- Database Agnostic ORM (supports MariaDB, MySQL, PostgresSQL & SQLite).
- Easy Testing.

Yaroo is heavily inspired by frameworks like Laravel, NestJS & ExpressJS.
