## About

Yaroo is a modern [Server-Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) framework written
on-top of [Pharaoh](https://pub.dev/packages/pharaoh) to make backend development in Dart
easy and peasy. It is very well in active development and is in use on projects such as
[Dart Blog](https://dart-blog.onrender.com).

Yaroo draws inspiration from popular frameworks like Laravel, NestJS, and ExpressJS, providing a streamlined learning experience. 
This allows you to efficiently develop your ideas without requiring extensive learning curve. Yaroo fosters common building blocks including:

- Middlewares.
- Controllers.
- Request, Response & NextFunction.
- Validation using [DTOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object).
- Service Providers.
