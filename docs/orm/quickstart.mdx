# Introduction

<Info>This package is still in active development. If you have any feedback or feature requests, write me and issue on github.</Info>

Yaroorm makes it easy to interact with databases. Currently, it provides official support for the following four databases:

- SQLite
- MariaDB
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

To get started, add yaroorm as a dependency and build_runner as a dev dependency:

```shell
dart pub add yaroorm
dart pub add build_runner --dev
```

## Migrations

Migrations are like teamwork tools for databases, ensuring everyone's on the same page when making changes without the need for manual adjustments.

```dart
import 'package:yaroorm/migration.dart';

class CreateUsersTable extends Migration {
  @override
  void up(List schemas) {
    final userSchema = Schema.create('users', (table) {
      return table
        ..id()
        ..string('name')
        ..string('email')
        ..string('password')
        ..timestamps();
    });

    schemas.add(userSchema);
  }

  @override
  void down(List schemas) {
    schemas.add(Schema.dropIfExists('users'));
  }
}
```
